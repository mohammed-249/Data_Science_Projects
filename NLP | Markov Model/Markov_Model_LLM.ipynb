We remain confident that once all the facts are presented in the larger case, the court will find Microsoft to be in full compliance with its contract with Sun, stated Tom Burt, Associate General Counsel for Microsoft Corporation. We are disappointed with this decision, but we will immediately comply with the Courts order. Microsoft has been in the forefront of helping developers use the Java programming language to write cutting-edge applications. The company has committed significant resources so that Java developers have the option of taking advantage of Windows features when writing software using the Java language.
