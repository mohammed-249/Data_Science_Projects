# Overview

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here, I showcase a diverse collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in the field of data science. From predictive modeling and natural language processing to image classification and neural networks, these projects highlight my ability to derive meaningful insights and build impactful solutions using advanced data science techniques.

# Projects
**Project 1:**  [**NLP | Building Knowledge Graph from videos**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/NLP%20%7C%20Building%20Knowledge%20Graph%20from%20videos)

*This project empowers you to extract valuable knowledge from video content and create meaningful connections between concepts, entities, and events within the transcriptions.*

**Project 2:**  [**NLP | Markov Model**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/NLP%20%7C%20Markov%20Model)

*The project involves implementing a Markov model in Python to generate random text based on a given input, with a focus on order, frequency, and text generation.*

**Project 3:**  [**Neural Networks | Handwriting Recognition**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Neural%20Networks%20%7C%20Handwriting%20Recognition)

*Handwriting Recognition with Neural Network: Python implementation using a three-layer neural network for recognizing handwritten digits with the MNIST dataset.*

**Project 4:**  [**Predictive Modeling for Agriculture**](https://github.com/mohammed-249/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Agriculture)

*still in progress*
