# Equitech Futures ADI Fellowship Capstone

## Medical Knowledge Graph from Doctor-Patient Conversations

This repository showcases my capstone project for the Equitech Futures Applied Data Institute (ADI) fellowship. The project focuses on building a knowledge graph from medical conversations between doctors and patients.

## Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Voice-to-Text Conversion
- Utilized the Whisper API for accurate and efficient conversion of voice data to text.

### 2. Medical Term Identification
- Integrated the BERN2 API to identify medical terms and relationships within the transcribed text.

### 3. Graph Database Management
- Employed Neo4j as the database to store and query the constructed medical knowledge graph.
