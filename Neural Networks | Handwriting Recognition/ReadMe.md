# Handwriting Recognition Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits. The project is implemented in Python, using the numpy library for numerical operations.

## Features

- Handwritten digit recognition using a feedforward neural network.
- Three-layer neural network (input and output layers, one hidden layer).
- Implementation of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training.
